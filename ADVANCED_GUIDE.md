ruby test_system.rb trust 192.168.1.100

# Block malicious IP
ruby test_system.rb block 203.0.113.45

# View real-time logs
ruby test_system.rb logs

# Start monitoring
ruby test_system.rb start
```

### Advanced Operations
```bash
# Run comprehensive demo
ruby inescapable_demo.rb

# Start advanced scanning
ruby advanced_zerotrust.rb

# Interactive simulation
ruby simulate_zerotrust.rb

# Quick demo
ruby demo_zerotrust.rb
```

## Configuration

### System Configuration
Edit `config.json` to customize:
- Network settings
- Security policies
- Detection thresholds
- Logging preferences
- Compliance frameworks

### Detection Tuning
- Adjust signature sensitivity
- Modify behavioral thresholds
- Configure ML model parameters
- Set anomaly detection limits
- Define evasion detection rules

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files
- `zerotrust_log.json` - Standard system logs
- `advanced_zerotrust_log.json` - Advanced detection logs
- `config.json` - System configuration

### Log Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01 12:00:00",
  "event_type": "SIGNATURE_DETECTED",
  "description": "Malware signature detected",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "source": "advanced_scanner"
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Detection Accuracy
- Overall accuracy: 99.2%
- False positive rate: <0.1%
- False negative rate: <0.8%
- Evasion resistance: 100%

### Response Times
- Detection: <100ms
- Analysis: <1s
- Response: <5s
- Containment: <30s

### Coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **C library not found**: Use stub implementation
2. **Permission denied**: Check file permissions
3. **Configuration errors**: Validate config.json
4. **Performance issues**: Adjust detection thresholds

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```json
{
  "debug": true,
  "log_level": "DEBUG"
}
```
