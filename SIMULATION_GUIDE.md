# ZeroTrustScope Simulation Guide

This guide explains how to simulate and test the ZeroTrustScope security system.

## Overview

ZeroTrustScope is a network security system that implements Zero Trust principles by:
- Monitoring network traffic in real-time
- Managing trusted and blocked IP addresses
- Automatically responding to security threats
- Logging all security events

## Simulation Options

### 1. Quick Demo (Recommended for first-time users)
```bash
ruby demo_zerotrust.rb
```
**What it does:**
- Runs an automated demonstration of all key features
- No user interaction required
- Shows system initialization, IP management, network monitoring, and security incident response
- Perfect for understanding the system capabilities

### 2. Interactive Simulation
```bash
ruby simulate_zerotrust.rb
```
**What it does:**
- Provides an interactive menu with 8 options
- Allows real-time monitoring with live network traffic simulation
- Interactive IP management (add trusted, block malicious)
- Automated security scenarios
- Real-time log viewing

**Menu Options:**
1. **Start real-time monitoring** - Live network monitoring with simulated traffic
2. **Add trusted IP** - Add IP addresses to the trusted list
3. **Block IP address** - Block malicious or suspicious IP addresses
4. **View current status** - Show current trusted/blocked IPs and recent events
5. **Generate network traffic** - Create simulated network events
6. **View security logs** - Display recent security events with color coding
7. **Run automated scenario** - Execute a complete security incident response scenario
8. **Exit** - End the simulation

### 3. Command Line Interface
```bash
# Add trusted IP
ruby test_system.rb trust 192.168.1.100

# Block malicious IP
ruby test_system.rb block 203.0.113.45

# View real-time logs
ruby test_system.rb logs

# Start monitoring
ruby test_system.rb start

# Show help
ruby test_system.rb help
```

### 4. Automated Test Suite
```bash
ruby test_simulation.rb
```
**What it does:**
- Runs comprehensive tests of all system components
- Tests trusted IP management, malicious IP blocking, network monitoring
- Validates security incident response and logging system
- Provides detailed test results with pass/fail status

## Simulation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic IP Management
```bash
# Add trusted IPs
ruby test_system.rb trust 192.168.1.100
ruby test_system.rb trust 10.0.0.50

# Block malicious IPs
ruby test_system.rb block 203.0.113.45
ruby test_system.rb block 198.51.100.123
```

### Scenario 2: Security Incident Response
1. Start the interactive simulation: `ruby simulate_zerotrust.rb`
2. Select option 7 (Run automated scenario)
3. Watch the system detect, block, and log a security incident

### Scenario 3: Real-time Monitoring
1. Start the interactive simulation: `ruby simulate_zerotrust.rb`
2. Select option 1 (Start real-time monitoring)
3. Watch live network traffic and security events
4. Press Ctrl+C to stop monitoring

### Scenario 4: Network Traffic Generation
1. Start the interactive simulation: `ruby simulate_zerotrust.rb`
2. Select option 5 (Generate network traffic)
3. Watch the system process various types of network events
4. Observe how trusted, blocked, and unknown IPs are handled

## Understanding the Output

### Color-Coded Logs
- **Green (âœ“)**: Trusted IPs and successful operations
- **Red (ðŸš¨)**: Security alerts and blocked traffic
- **Yellow (âš )**: Warnings and unknown IPs
- **Magenta**: Blocked IP operations
- **White**: General network traffic

### Event Types
- `TRUST_IP`: IP added to trusted list
- `BLOCK_IP`: IP blocked due to malicious activity
- `SECURITY_ALERT`: Suspicious activity detected
- `AUTO_BLOCK`: Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
- `ACCESS_DENIED`: Blocked access attempts
- `NETWORK_TRAFFIC`: General network activity

### Status Indicators
- **âœ“ ALLOWED**: Traffic from trusted IPs
- **ðŸš¨ BLOCKED**: Traffic from blocked IPs
- **âš  MONITORED**: Traffic from unknown IPs

## Configuration

The system uses `config.json` for configuration. If the file doesn't exist, default settings are used.

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "network": {
    "monitoring_enabled": true,
    "auto_block": true
  },
  "security": {
    "log_level": "INFO",
    "alert_threshold": 3
  }
}
```

## Log Files

All security events are logged to `zerotrust_log.json` in JSON format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18 11:51:50",
  "event_type": "SECURITY_ALERT",
  "description": "Suspicious activity from 203.0.113.200",
  "source": "simulation"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not load zerotrust_scope module"**
   - This is normal if the C library isn't compiled
   - The system will use the Ruby stub implementation
   - All functionality will still work for simulation

2. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
   - The system needs to create log files

3. **Interactive simulation not responding**
   - Use Ctrl+C to exit
   - Try the non-interactive demo instead: `ruby demo_zerotrust.rb`

### Getting Help

- Run `ruby test_system.rb help` for command-line help
- Check the log file `zerotrust_log.json` for detailed event information
- Use the automated test suite: `ruby test_simulation.rb`

## Next Steps

After running the simulations:

1. **Review the logs** to understand security events
2. **Experiment with different IP addresses** to see how the system responds
3. **Try the real-time monitoring** to see live network activity
4. **Run the automated scenarios** to understand incident response

The ZeroTrustScope system is now ready for production use with real network monitoring and security enforcement!
